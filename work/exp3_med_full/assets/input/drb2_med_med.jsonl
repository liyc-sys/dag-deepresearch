{"question": "I want you to conduct a comprehensive review of the effectiveness of salt substitutes on cardiovascular outcomes, based on randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to March 2022. Your review should consist of three parts.\n\nFirst, create a summary table of the key characteristics of the included clinical trials. This table should be named 'Characteristics of Included Clinical Trials' and must include the following columns for each study: Study (First Author and Year), Country, Design, Salt Substitute Composition, Control Group Salt Type, Baseline Systolic Blood Pressure (mmHg), Baseline Diastolic Blood Pressure (mmHg), and Follow-up Duration.\n\nSecond, analyze the study findings based on the data. This analysis should explain the overall significance of the findings for blood pressure control and mortality. The results of subgroup analyses should also be discussed, especially how the effect of salt substitutes on blood pressure varies by age (<60 years vs. >=60 years), sample size (<300 vs. >=300 participants), and study duration (<12 months vs. >=12 months).

{"question": "I am researching T-cell exhaustion. Please compile a comprehensive report on this topic for me, based on publicly available literature published before July 2023. The report needs to include the following core sections:\n\n1.  **Definition and Characteristics**: First, clearly explain what T-cell exhaustion is. Then, describe in detail the characteristics of Exhausted T cells (Tex) from four key dimensions: transcription factors, inhibitory receptors, effector functions, and metabolic activity. For each dimension, please list the key molecules or states and explain their specific changes and roles in the exhaustion process.\n\n2.  **Comparison of Transcription Factor Expression Profiles**: Please create a table comparing the expression levels of key transcription factors in Effector T cells, Progenitor exhausted T cells, and Terminally exhausted T cells. The table needs to include the following transcription factors: TCF-1, T-bet to EOMES ratio, BATF, NFAT, PRDM1, NR4A, and TOX. Please fill in the table content with 'High', 'Low', 'Unclear', or more specific descriptions (e.g., 'forms NFAT homodimers').\n\n3.  **Comparison of Research Methods**: Currently, there are two main approaches to studying T-cell exhaustion: direct isolation from mouse models/human tissues, and in vitro induction/generation. Please also create a table comparing these two methods from the following aspects:\n    *   Method of isolation/generation\n    *   Time to isolate/generate Tex cells\n    *   Cell yields for future testing\n    *   Access to samples\n    *   Mechanistic studies\n    *   Assigning cause-effect\n\n4.  **Comprehensive Analysis**: Finally, based on the above information, analyze the advantages and limitations of generating exhausted T cells in vitro for research, particularly what challenges in vitro models face in simulating real physiological processes compared to direct in vivo isolation?\n\n**important**The following is a rule of highest priority that you must not violate.
